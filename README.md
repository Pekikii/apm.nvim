# apm.nvim

This is a Neovim plugin that tracks your keypresses and displays your APM (actions per minute) in the statusline. Unlike Primeagen's plugin, this one works.

## Installation

With [Packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use 'Pekikii/apm.nvim' 
```

and call `:PackerInstall`
